## Deployment Requirements

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Azure AD Application Registration
You must register the application in Azure Active Directory to enable Office 365 integration:

**Required Azure AD Permissions:**
- `Mail.Read` - Read mail in all mailboxes
- `Mail.ReadBasic` - Read basic mail information
- `User.Read` - Read user profile
- `MailboxSettings.Read` - Read mailbox settings

**Application Registration Steps:**
1. Navigate to Azure Portal ‚Üí Azure Active Directory ‚Üí App registrations
2. Create new registration with these settings:
   - Name: "Email Dashboard - TV Schedule"
   - Account types: "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
   - Redirect URI: `https://yourdomain.com/` (production URL)
3. Configure API permissions (listed above)
4. Generate client secret for server-side authentication
5. Note the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID

#### 2. Shared Mailbox Configuration
Configure the `TV.Schedule@pamediagroup.com` mailbox:

**Mailbox Settings:**
- Ensure mailbox is configured as a shared mailbox
- Grant appropriate users "Full Access" permissions
- Configure any required retention policies
- Set up any necessary forwarding rules

**User Permissions Required:**
- Users must have "Full Access" to the TV.Schedule mailbox
- Users must be licensed for Office 365 (Exchange Online Plan 1 or higher)
- Users must be in the same Azure AD tenant as the application

#### 3. Environment Configuration
Create production environment variables:

```bash
# Azure AD Configuration
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-application-client-id
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-application-secret
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-application-client-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/

# Mailbox Configuration
SHARED_MAILBOX_ADDRESS=TV.Schedule@pamediagroup.com
```

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
Vercel provides seamless Next.js deployment with automatic scaling:

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically on code changes

**Vercel Configuration:**
```json
{
  "name": "email-dashboard",
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "AZURE_CLIENT_ID": "@azure-client-id",
    "AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET": "@azure-client-secret",
    "AZURE_TENANT_ID": "@azure-tenant-id"
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Azure App Service
Deploy directly to Microsoft Azure for tighter integration:

**Benefits:**
- Native Azure integration
- Built-in SSL certificates
- Automatic scaling
- Integrated monitoring

**Deployment Process:**
1. Create Azure App Service (Node.js runtime)
2. Configure application settings with environment variables
3. Set up deployment from GitHub
4. Configure custom domain if required

#### Option 3: Docker Deployment
For containerized deployment on any cloud platform:

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Post-Deployment Configuration

#### 1. DNS and SSL
- Configure custom domain pointing to deployment
- Ensure SSL/TLS certificate is properly configured
- Update Azure AD redirect URIs with production domain

#### 2. User Access Management
**Adding Users:**
1. Ensure users have Office 365 licenses
2. Grant "Full Access" to TV.Schedule mailbox:
   ```powershell
   Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "TV.Schedule@pamediagroup.com" -User "user@pamediagroup.com" -AccessRights FullAccess
   ```
3. Users can then access the application with their Office 365 credentials

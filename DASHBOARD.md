**Deployment Process:**
1. Create Azure App Service (Node.js runtime)
2. Configure application settings with environment variables
3. Set up deployment from GitHub
4. Configure custom domain if required

#### Option 3: Docker Deployment
For containerized deployment on any cloud platform:

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Post-Deployment Configuration

#### 1. DNS and SSL
- Configure custom domain pointing to deployment
- Ensure SSL/TLS certificate is properly configured
- Update Azure AD redirect URIs with production domain

#### 2. User Access Management

**Step-by-Step User Setup:**

1. **Verify Office 365 License**
   ```powershell
   Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName "user@pamediagroup.com" | Select-Object DisplayName, IsLicensed, Licenses
   ```

2. **Grant Mailbox Permissions**
   ```powershell
   # Full Access (recommended for primary users)
   Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "TV.Schedule@pamediagroup.com" -User "user@pamediagroup.com" -AccessRights FullAccess
   
   # Read-Only Access (for secondary users)
   Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "TV.Schedule@pamediagroup.com" -User "user@pamediagroup.com" -AccessRights ReadPermission
   
   # Verify permissions
   Get-MailboxPermission -Identity "TV.Schedule@pamediagroup.com" | Where-Object {$_.User -eq "user@pamediagroup.com"}
   ```

3. **Optional: Create Azure AD Security Group**
   ```powershell
   # Create group for application users
   New-AzureADGroup -DisplayName "TV Schedule Dashboard Users" -MailEnabled $false -SecurityEnabled $true -MailNickName "TVScheduleUsers"
   
   # Add users to group
   Add-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId "group-object-id" -RefObjectId "user-object-id"
   ```

4. **Test User Access**
   - User should test with demo mode first
   - Verify authentication works correctly
   - Check mailbox access permissions
   - Validate application functionality

**Removing User Access:**
```powershell
# Remove mailbox permissions
Remove-MailboxPermission -Identity "TV.Schedule@pamediagroup.com" -User "user@pamediagroup.com" -AccessRights FullAccess -Confirm:$false

# Remove from Azure AD group (if using)
Remove-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId "group-object-id" -MemberId "user-object-id"
```

**Bulk User Management:**
```powershell
# Import users from CSV
$users = Import-Csv "users.csv"
foreach ($user in $users) {
    Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "TV.Schedule@pamediagroup.com" -User $user.Email -AccessRights FullAccess
    Write-Host "Added access for: $($user.Email)"
}
```

#### 3. Monitoring and Maintenance

**Application Monitoring:**
- Set up application performance monitoring
- Configure error tracking and logging
- Monitor authentication success/failure rates
- Track API usage and rate limits

**Multi-User Monitoring:**
```powershell
# Monitor active users
Get-MailboxPermission -Identity "TV.Schedule@pamediagroup.com" | Where-Object {$_.AccessRights -eq "FullAccess" -and $_.IsInherited -eq $false}

# Check last login activity
Get-MsolUser -All | Select-Object DisplayName, UserPrincipalName, LastLogonTime | Where-Object {$_.LastLogonTime -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-30)}

# Monitor API usage by user
# (Requires Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 for detailed logs)
```

**Regular Maintenance:**
- Update dependencies monthly
- Monitor Microsoft Graph API changes
- Review and update permissions as needed
- Backup configuration and settings
- Quarterly user access reviews

```

**Load Balancing:**
- Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer
- Use Redis for shared session storage
- Implement circuit breakers for API failures
- Monitor response times and error rates

**Database Considerations:**
- Consider Azure Cosmos DB for user preferences
- Implement local storage for temporary data
- Use IndexedDB for offline capabilities
- Regular cleanup of cached data
